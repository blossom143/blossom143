## Hello, hello 👋👋 

I’m **Tsomorlig** , I’m a **Data Engineer** with a **B.S. in Software Engineering**, currently pursuing my **M.S. in Engineering Science (Data Science)**. 

**I excel in Cloud-Native Data Engineering & MLOps**

I bridge the gap between complex data modeling and high-availability system architecture. With a background leading teams to maintain 99.9% uptime for microservices and implementing MLOps from scratch, I specialize in building resilient, automated data ecosystems.
