## 👋 Hii ✨  



I’m **Tsomorlig** , I’m a **Data Engineer** with a **B.S. in Software Engineering**, currently pursuing my **M.S. in Engineering Science (Data Science)**, I bridge the gap between complex data modeling and high-availability system architecture.

With a background leading teams to maintain 99.9% uptime for microservices and implementing MLOps from scratch, I specialize in building resilient, automated data ecosystems. I don't just move data; I ensure it is governed, scalable, and cost-efficient.

Core Focus: Cloud-Native Data Engineering • MLOps • Infrastructure as Code • ELT/ETL Optimization.

📍 Buffalo, New York
